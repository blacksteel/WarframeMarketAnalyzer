# WarframeMarketAnalyzer

Hi all! New to GitHub and still getting it set up. I'm a huge Warframe fan and also a professional mathematician and software engineer by day, so I've been working on a project with the working title WarframeMarketAnalyzer to automate a lot of the drudge work that goes into trading and inventory management, among other aspects of the game. Since I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like a tool like this, I wanted to share it with the Warframe community.

You can find the current version of WMA as both an exe and a runnable Jar on our releases page. I am releasing the source code for this project under the MIT open source license. I haven't put together any documentation for the program yet, but for now you can find info about the features in these two posts:
